This repositiory contains work and solutions to 538 ridder puzzles that are posted at fivethirtyeight.com on Friday mornings
at 8:00AM EST. The puzzles are filed on this page https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/. I also may start posting work
on problems from the riddler book soon, the format of these files will be the same but the file name will include the page
number of the riddler rather than the date in the format of days/month/year. Hopefully these are helpful and interesting for
you other riddlers out there. The solutions are posted on the following week's riddler if people would like to double check
my work or look at other ways to approach the riddles.
